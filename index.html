			<img class="Pic rightFloat" src="Greg.jpg" alt="Picture of Greg starting blankly at camera" width="250" height="250">
			<p>My name is Gregory Pugh. I prefer to be called Greg. My hobbies consist of gaming, listening to music, and reading. When I was younger I got an extreme case of strep throat that turned into scarlet fever. That damaged my heart. When I was 15 I had
				heart surgery to correct some of those issues. I still have to get yearly checkups.About the age of 15 I was diagnosed with severe scoliosis that has come with its own set of unique issues and hurdles that I have had to overcome. My family moved to
				the state of Missouri about 10 years ago I graduated from Branson High School.</p>
